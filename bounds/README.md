### List of bounds

- **CMBAccretion**: CMB bounds from the accretion of baryonic mater around EDOs, altering recombination history. Fig.7 in [arXiv:2403.13072](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13072).
- **EROS-2**: Microlensing constraints on extended objects from EROS-2, from [arXiv:2002.08962](https://arxiv.org/abs/ArXiv:2002.08962).
- **OGLE-IV**: Microlensing constraints on extended objects from OGLE-IV, from [arXiv:2002.08962](https://arxiv.org/abs/ArXiv:2002.08962).
- **Subaru-HSC**: Subaru-HSC microlensing constraints on extended objects (with extended sources), from [arXiv:2007.12697](https://arxiv.org/abs/ArXiv:2007.12697).
- **Dynamical heating**: Constraints from the dynamical heating of stars. These were calculated for a different cut-off for the NFW sub-halo density function; they are only consistent with our parametrisation until R_90=10^6. Fig.5 (right) in [arXiv:2404.01378](https://arxiv.org/abs/ArXiv:2404.01378).
- **LVK**: Gravitational wave constraints from ground-based experiments LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK). These bounds depend on when the EDO binaries were formed; herein, we include those bounds for EDOs formed in the early universe. Fig. 3 (right) in  [arXiv:2205.15396](https://arxiv.org/abs/ArXiv:2205.15396).
- **Binary Evaporation**: Effect of EDOs on the evaporation of wide binaries under a timescale of 10Gyrs. Fig.4 in [arXiv:2404.18099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18099)
